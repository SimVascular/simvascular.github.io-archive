# 0D Solver #

Zero-dimensional (0D) models are lightweight methods to simulate bulk hemodynamic quantities in the cardiovascular system. Unlike 3D and 1D models, 0D models are purely time-dependent; they are unable to simulate spatial patterns in the hemodynamics. 0D models primarily simulate bulk cardiovascular flow rates and pressures; however, they can simulate other hemodynamic quantities, such as wall shear stress [1] or volume, as well. Furthermore, 0D models are highly modular and compartmentalized, meaning different regions of the 0D models represent the hemodynamics in different parts of the cardiovascular anatomy being modeled.

0D models are analogous to electrical circuits. The flow rate simulated by 0D models represents electrical current, while the pressure represents voltage. Three primary building blocks of 0D models are resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Resistance captures the viscous effects of blood flow, capacitance represents the compliance and distensibility of the vessel wall, and inductance represents the inertia of the blood flow. Different combinations of these building blocks, as well as others, can be formed to reflect the hemodynamics and physiology of different cardiovascular anatomies.
