###Text Editor Mode 
Selecting the <b>Python Console</b> <b>Text Editor</b> button switches to a panel that is used to read, edit, save, and 
execute Python scripts. This is the preferred method to use when developing Python scripts that need to be have access to 
the **SV Data Manager**. A new Python script can be interactively written, tested and saved to a file. It can later be 
read in and executed. 
For example, the <b> PathDemo.py </b> script can be read in and executed by pressing the
<img src="documentation/python_interface/imgs/play-icon.png" width="15" height="15"> button.

  <figcaption class="svCaption" > Reading and executing the <b> PathDemo.py </b> script. </figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

After a script is executed the variables and functions defined by it are available in the <b>Console</b>. Variables defined in the <b>Console</b> are
also available in the <b>Text Editor</b>.
