## Preparing SimVascular solver files for GenBC

We will assume at this point that you will have already built the geometry of your model and meshed it using the model construction 
pipeline in SimVascular. This tutorial will start right at the **Simulations** module. Create a new Simulation job by right-clicking 
the **Simulations** item in the **Data Manager**, then click **Create New Simulation Job**. Select the appropriate Model from the 
drop down menu and give it the name **cyl_sim**. Navigate through the various tabs to set simulation parameters discussed 
in <a href="http://simvascular.github.io/docsQuickGuide.html#simulation"> Quick Guide / Simulations</a>. In particular, the values for 
**Number of Time Steps**, **Time Step Size** and **Number of Timesteps between Restarts** parameters under the **Solver Parameters** 
tab must be set.

During execution the solver will normalize the velocity profile of the Dirichlet inlets to have a flow of 1.0 and then multiply 
the velocity profile by the flow that is computed in GenBC. Caps with Dirichlet boundary conditions are typically connected to 
an inductor or have a specified flow waveform (e.g. measured or adapted from literature). For the cylinder example we want to specify the 
**inlet** face to have a Dirichlet boundary condition. To set a Dirichlet boundary condition for the **inlet** cap double-click the 
box in the row of the cap **Name** and the column of the **BC Type** and select **Prescribed Velocities** from the drop-down menu. 
Double-click the cap name under **Name** to open up a window with additional parameters. Set **BC Type** to 
**Prescribed Velocities** and set **Analytic Shape** to **parabolic**. For the flow rate select the **inlet.flow** file from the 
project's **simulation-files** directory.

A Neumann boundary condition is typically used for caps that interface directly with either a capacitor or a resistor. 
For the **outlet** cap we specify a Neumann boundary condition by selecting **Resistance** for the **BC Type** and assigning it 
a value of 0. These settings are used to create the appropriate entries in the **solver.inp** file we will later modify. 
The **Inlet and Outlet BCs** tab should now look like this

To create the data files for the simulation go to the **Create Files and Run Simulation** tab, select the appropriate mesh from 
the drop down menu and click **Create Data Files for Simulation**. The simulation files are written to the project directory inside 
the **Simulations** folder. In this folder you will see a folder for the simulation job you created named **cyl_sim**. Inside this 
folder are the following files and folders:

	1. mesh-complete – Contains mesh information and discretization in VTK format files
	2. bct.dat and bct.vtp – Contains velocity profile information on your Dirichlet caps
	3. cyl_sim.svpre file – Pre-solver script which instructs SimVascular how to prepare the simulation files
               from your mesh. Contains the ID numbers for mesh surfaces (used later)
	4. geombc.dat.1 – Simulation file that contains geometry information
	5. inlet.flow - .flow file which has the template flow information at your inlet face(s)
	6. numstart.dat – Dummy file which tells the solver on which timestep to start on
	7. restart.0.1 – Contains initial conditions for pressure and velocity in your simulations
	8. solver.inp – Solver settings file

Surfaces are identified using integer IDs automatically generated by SimVascular and assigned to surfaces in 
the **.svpre** file using the **set\_surface\_id\_vtp** command

We need to manually modify the **solver.inp** file to use GenBC. Edit the **solver.inp** file with a text editor and scroll down to 
the section right below **Step Construction**. You wil see following three commands for Resistance boundary conditions

	Number of Resistance Surfaces: 1
	List of Resistance Surfaces: 3
	Resistance Values: 0

These commands were created for the **outlet** cap Neumann boundary condition but are not needed and so we delete them.

We next need to add commands to instruct the solver to look for GenBC and all the inlet/outlet surfaces. Below the **Step Construction** 
command add 

	Find the GenBC Inside the Running Directory: True
	Number of Timesteps for GenBC Initialization: 0

We next add commands identifyibng the inlet Dirichlet surfaces

	Number of Dirichlet Surfaces: 1
	List of Dirichlet Surfaces: 2

The **Number of Dirichlet Surfaces** command specifies the total number of caps in your model where Dirichlet boundary condition are 
defined for GenBC. The **List of Dirichlet Surfaces** is a space-delimited list surface IDs for the Dirichlet boundary conditions.
For the cylinder model the **inlet** is assigned ID 2. 

We now add a similar commandes for surfaces with Neumann boundary conditios 

	Number of Neumann Surfaces: 1    
	List of Neumann Surfaces: 3 

We now change the value of **Number of Coupled Surfaces** to the total number of Dirichlet and Neumann surfaces in your model. 
This is to indicate that these surfaces are coupled in the sense that the flow and pressure have the potential to be coupled in 
the GenBC formulation. For this example the number of coupled surfaces is 2 because we have 1 Dirichlet surface and 1 Neumann surface.

After making these changes the **solver.inp** file should look like
