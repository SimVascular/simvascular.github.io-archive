## Mesh Generation ##

Mesh generation for cardiac mechanics modeling are quite standard and can be achieved following the general guide <a href="http://simvascular.github.io/docssvFSI.html#mesh">here</a>.

On the other hand, the heart wall is a composite of layers (or sheets) of parallel myocytes, which are the predominant fiber types. These fiber and sheet directions enable defining a local orthonormal coordinate system inside the cardiac muscle. This local coordinate system is crucial for using a structurally-based constitutive relation for the cardiac muscle <a href="#ref-9">[9]</a>. For 3D problems, the users are required to prescribe fiber and sheet directions in the computational domain for certain constitutive relations. Users are provided an option to define a constant fiber direction through the following input directives,

```
# Fiber direction
Fiber direction: (1.0, 0.0, 0.0)

# Sheet direction
Fiber direction: (0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
```

**svFSI** also supports specifying distributed fiber and sheet direction generated by rule-based methods <a href="#ref-3">[3]</a> through the following input commands,

```
# Fiber direction
Fiber direction file path: fibersLong.vtu

# Sheet direction
Fiber direction file path: fibersSheet.vtu
```

In the latter approach, the vtu file should have the local coordinate system stored as a vector with the name "FIB_DIR" at the centroid of each element. An example is provided <a href="https://github.com/SimVascular/svFSI-Tests/blob/master/06-ustruct/03-LV-Guccione-active/mesh/P1/fibersLong.vtu">here</a>.
