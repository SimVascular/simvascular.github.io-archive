SimVascular is an interactive application used to created patient-specific geometric models of human vasculature from 3D medical
imaging data acquired for a specific anatomical region. These models are then used as the basis for blood flow simulations using 
various numerical methods. The sequence of steps used by SimVascular to do this is called the <i>image-based modeling pipeline</i>. 

The SimVascular graphical user interface (GUI) is used to interactively manage each step in the image-based modeling pipeline. 
The <a href="#gui"> GUI </a> provides different graphical controls (e.g. buttons) used to input the data required to generate 
the output (e.g. geometric model) of each step. The display of image and geometrical data in a graphics window can be interactively
controlled using the mouse. Information from image and geometrical data can also be queried using the mouse and allows selecting,
for example, a point in 3D space
