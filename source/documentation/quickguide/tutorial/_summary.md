<h2 id="tutorial_summary">Summary</h2>

This <i>Tutorial</i> has demonstrated how to use the SimVascular image-based modeling pipeline to create patient-specific geometric 
models suitable for CFD blood flow simulations. It should provide a foundation for creating custom models and performing simulations 
applicable to a variety of research areas.

The SimVascular <i>User Guides</i> and <i>Clinical Cases</i> documentation provides more detailed information about all the
topics covered in this <i>Tutorial</i>. 

The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1CBZ8Wh-xvSKUsuBA4MM4Jba-psVdxXT">SimVascular Online Tutorials</a> video series
provides live demonstrations by experienced users building models and setting up simulations for different applications.

The <a href="https://simtk.org/plugins/phpBB/indexPhpbb.php?group_id=188&pluginname=phpBB">SimVascular Forum</a> is an additional 
resource for seeking answers for specific questions. Searching the <i>Forum</i> can be very helpful for providing tips and solutions
to any SimVascular quirks and limitations.

Functionality not supported by the SimVascular GUI may be implemented using the <a href="http://simvascular.github.io/docsPythonInterface.html">Python API</a>.
