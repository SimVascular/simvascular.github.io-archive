## Meshing
A comprehensive overview of meshing with simvascular can be found elsewhere. Briefly, a solid model of format .vtp can be loaded into simvascular. It can then be remeshed, and subsequently the entire model can be exported. The full model should consist of:

<ol>
    <li>A solid mesh (.vtu format)</li>
    <li>Right ventricular endocardial surface mesh (.vtp format)</li>
    <li>Left ventricular endocardial surface mesh (.vtp format)</li>
    <li>Top surface mesh (.vtp format)</li>
    <li>Epicardial surface mesh (.vtp format)</li>
</ol>

ðŸš¨ Important! For single ventricle models, there will one fewer surface meshes.

For the current task of fiber generation, we will need an additional surface mesh that is not typically produced by simvascular. This mesh will correspond to the apex fo the heart. This can be generated by importing the epicardial surface mesh (.vtp). This will look something like what is shown below in **Figure 1A**.

**Figure 1B** shows the rotated epicardial mesh surface. The magenta spotlight indicates our target location for defining the apex. **Figure 1C** shows application of the [clip filter in paraview](https://docs.paraview.org/en/latest/UsersGuide/filteringData.html#clip "clip filter in paraview"), which can be used to trim the epicardial surface down to just the region defining the apex. **Figure 1D** shows proper rotation of the clip axis such that it is taking axial slices of the myocardium. **Figure 1E** shows the result of clipping. Note that in **Figure 1E**, the 'crinkle clip' setting is not toggled. This will create problems for svFSI later, so be sure to select 'crinkle clip'. The result with 'crinkle clip' is shown in **Figure 1F**. Note the jagged edges.
