## Known Issues ##

<ol>
    <li>SimVascular does not record that the plugin was added to a project. The plugin must be added to the project every time a project is opened. The project **Purkinje-Network** directory is saved between project sessions.</li>

    <li>The tool may not work if the Purkinje Network tool is added to a project before a mesh is created or loaded. </li>

    <li>The Purkinje Network tool does not know when the mesh changes. If the mesh is changed then the project must be saved and then reopened.</li>

    <li>There is no error reporting from the Python script. Users must check the console window for errors.</li>

    <li>The vtu mesh generated by the plugin cannot be read by svFSI as it is in ASCII format. A temporary solution is to export a regular appended/binary vtu from Paraview.</li>
</ol>
