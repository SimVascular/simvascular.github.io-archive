Cardiovascular applications that involve significant deformation are difficult to simulate and model. Some examples include vascular simulations where the wall dilates to more than 10% of the vessel diameter, cardiac simulations where the heart wall displaces as it contracts and expands, or coronary simulations where the coronary vessels displace with the motion of the heart.

One way to computationally model situations like these is to use a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) solver. In FSI, separate domains are defined for the fluid part and solid parts of the computational geometry. The respective equations governing fluid flow (typically Navier-Stokes) are solved in the fluid domain, while the equations governing solid mechanics are solved in the solid domain. The two domains then interact through their *interface* where the solution variables (displacements, velocities, pressures, stresses) are required to match. This interface acts as a coupled boundary condition for both domains, as the solution of one domain will affect the solution in the other, and vice-versa.

SimVascular utilizes Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eularian (ALE) coordinates to perform FSI. As the name implies, this method is a combination of the Eularian and Lagrangian descriptions of motion that is particularly well suited for FSI problems. In the Eularian description, the computational mesh stays fixed and the motion is characterized as velocities flowing past the grid nodes. The Eularian description is typical for most fluid dynamics problems without FSI. While in the Lagrangian description, the mesh nodes move exactly with the motion of the fluid or solid and thus are often characterized as *moving domain* problems. Lagrangian problems are also often described in terms of the *reference* configuration (the initial computational geometry before any motion) and the *current* configuration (the current state of the geometry and mesh nodes). ALE combines these descriptions into a formulation that is convenient for describing FSI problems, where the mesh motion does not exactly match with the fluid motion, but instead a *mesh velocity* term is added to the convective term in the Navier-Stokes equations. More information can be found in the literature.

SimVascular provides an ALE-FSI solver in svFSI that has many features that make it convenient for modeling cardiovascular flows. First, svFSI is able to directly read in mesh formats that SimVascular outputs and use them directly in simulations. Second, svFSI provides capabilities to apply inflow and outflow boundary conditions that are common in cardiovascular modeling. These boundary conditions include specifying the flow rate at an inlet face with either a flat or parabolic profile, Neumann pressure boundary conditions, and outlet resistance boundary conditions that relate the flow and pressure.
