## Automated Image Segmentation 

The SimVascular <strong>Cardiac Geometric Modeling Tool</strong> uses pre-trained deep neural network models to automatically 
generate segmentations of major cardiac structures: the four heart chambers, aorta and pulmonary arteries. The segmentation tool 
uses an ensemble of two-dimensional (2D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automatic segmentation of cardiac structures from 
three-dimensional (3D) patient images. It has been shown to have superior performance compared to prior approaches when evaluated on 
a benchmark dataset containing both magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) image data <a href="#ref-1">[1]</a>. 
The tool can be used from both the SimVascular GUI Python console and from the command line within the SimVascular Python 
environment.
